**FILEKEEPING HEADER**

Code Overview:
This file contains the main logic for a multiplayer game that can be played by up to 10 people.
It includes a Game class to manage the game state and player interactions.

Key Insights:
- The game supports multiple players (up to 10)
- Uses a simple turn-based structure
- Implements basic game logic with placeholders for more complex mechanics

LLM Mistakes and Explicit Instructions:
None at this time.

Explored Approaches:
Initial implementation of a basic multiplayer game structure.

Observations:
The current implementation is a skeleton and will need further development based on specific game rules and mechanics.

User Code Lock:
None at this time.

References and Resources:
None at this time.

Todo List:
- Implement specific game rules and mechanics
- Add more complex player interactions
- Implement a scoring system
- Add game end conditions
